Linux-mdl kernel
================

Fork of the mainline Linux kernel, maintained by Michael D Labriola
<veggiemike@sourceruckus.org>, with interesting out-of-tree projects (e.g.,
[DRBD9](https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd),
[OpenZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs)) merged in and updated for the last
couple longterm series.

The following upstream projects have been merged in, with compilation problems
fixed as needed.

- OpenZFS v2.1.12
- DRBD v9.2.5

I've also started controlling my .config in git, to make my life easier.

See [NOTES-mdl](/NOTES-mdl) for more details.
