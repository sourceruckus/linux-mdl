These sources have been copied in from the official upstream drbd git repo at
https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd.git, and modified slightly to build in-tree.
Here's how it's done:

1. Make sure you've got a checked out kernel source tree, already configured
   and built once.  For this example, let's say you did that at /scrap/linux.

2. Somewhere, clone the upstream drbd git repo.  For this example, let's say
   you did it at /scrap/drbd.

3. Checkout the appropriate branch.  For this example, let's say you've checked
   out drbd-9.0.

4. At the toplevel of your drbd checkout, make sure all submodules are up to
   date and then do:

   % make KDIR=/scrap/linux/

   or if you want to use an installed kernel tree:

   % make KVER=version
   
   This will fail if you haven't installed coccinelle >= 1.0.8.  If needed,
   compile and install it, then try again.  If building for the current kernel
   fails, figure out why by looking at kernel git log since previous release
   and submit patches to drbd-dev@lists.linbit.com.

5. Run the import-upstream script like this:

   % ./import-upstream /scrap/drbd

6. Commit the resulting files.

7. Then modify Makefile after reviewing diffs and comments.
